## About me
I'm a software developer apprentice and I'm currently working for [Expedia Group](https://www.expediagroup.com), partnered with [Multiverse Apprenticeships](https://www.multiverse.io/en-US/programs). I also graduated in Computer Science at [Renton Technical College](https://www.rtc.edu) in 2020. 

In my current role, I work with a team of developers to build and maintain critical backend services for Expedia Group. I've been responsible for the development of the platform's metrics collection and monitoring. I work with Java, Kotlin, and Spring Boot, and I'm familiar with writing documentation, working with CI/CD pipelines, and vulnerability management.

I'm passionate about software development and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and improve my skills. I also enjoy playing music, and I've been playing the guitar for over 10 years.
