### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a 3rd year student of Computer Science focusing primarily on software engineering and application development. I love solving problems and coming up with creative solutions through coding, and here on my GitHub you can see a lot of my own projects through school or just personal projects. I plan to travel around the world a little bit at a time starting soon, and I am seeking job opportunities either remote or in Seattle. My LinkedIn link is in the bio if you would like to connect!
