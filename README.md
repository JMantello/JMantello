### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I earned my Associate's in Computer Science from Renton Technical College in 2022 and am working as a software development engineer apprentice in Seattle, Washington. I love solving problems and coming up with creative solutions through coding. Here on my GitHub you can see a lot of my projects from school or just personal projects. I plan to travel around the world a little bit at a time starting soon. My LinkedIn link is in the bio if you want to connect!
